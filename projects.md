# My projects!

Mainly stuff I encountered during my studies.

## TaylorInterface.jl

[TaylorInterface.jl](https://www.github.com/alseidon/TaylorInterface.jl) yey, soon in general registry (should take the time to do it soon). It's fast, it's easy, and it's in dire need of feedback - go take a look!

## Black hole rendering

Computer graphics course, MPRI. OpenGL, ray-tracing, very crude approach (mainly for educational purposes). Shaders are a ton of fun, you should try them out and mess with them.

## Lykeion

Academic forum, somewhere between arXiv and StackOverflow. Hopefully, a replacement to peer-reviewed blood-suckers - ehm, I mean scientific editors.
