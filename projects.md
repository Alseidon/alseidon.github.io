# My projects!

Mainly stuff I encountered during my studies.

## TaylorInterface.jl

[TaylorInterface.jl](https://www.github.com/alseidon/TaylorInterface.jl) is now in the general Julia registry, yey! Fast ODE integration, with integration of variation equations to an arbitrary order: it is a Julia interface to the powerful [taylor](https://github.com/joang/taylor2-dist) tool. It's fast, it's easy, and it's in dire need of feedback - go take a look!

## Rains of Castamere

A digital version of a competitive card game prototype called Rains of Castamere by the excellent [Yves Charamel-Lenain](https://charajeux.wordpress.com/). No commercial use intended, please don't sue me! The project is done in Godot, and private for the moment. Will post more about it when it will be in a playable state.

## Black hole rendering

Computer graphics course, [MPRI](https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php). OpenGL, ray-tracing, very crude approach (mainly for educational purposes). Shaders are a ton of fun, you should try them out and mess with them.

## Lykeion

Academic forum, somewhere between arXiv and StackOverflow. Hopefully, a replacement to peer-reviewed blood-suckers - ehm, I mean scientific editors.
