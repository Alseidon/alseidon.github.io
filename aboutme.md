## Who am I

Alexandre. A PhD student in celestial mechanics. A programming enthusiast, especially in [Julia](https://julialang.org). Actually, enthusiast about a tad bit too many [hobbies](/hobbies).

## What do I do

### Research
I'm working at the interface between celestial mechanics, dynamical systems and numerical optimisation. See [Research](/research) for more.

### Scientific outreach
I also work at the [Cit√© des Sciences et de l'Industrie](https://www.cite-sciences.fr/fr/accueil/), with the scientific outreach team. Here, I learned how to talk about science to kids and general public, and prepared several animations about science in general, and my work in particular (for instance, a roleplaying game about celestial mechanics!).

### Scientific life
I relaunched and am the current organizer of the Paris Julia meetup, [Julia Paris et Environ](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/julia-paris/). I am also a member of the organizing committee for the [JuliaCon Local Paris 2025](https://juliacon.org/local/paris2025/).

### Beyond work
Way too many [hobbies](/hobbies). Currently hyperfocusing on game development with Godot.
