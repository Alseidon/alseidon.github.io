# About me

Hi! I'm a long-time space and physics enthusiast, and I had the chance to realize my dream of... well, not going to space, but studying it!

Currently, I am a PhD student at the [LTE](https://lte.observatoiredeparis.psl.eu/) (ex-IMCCE) laboratory, at the Observatoire de Paris, under the supervision of [Jacques Fejoz](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~fejoz/) and [Philippe Robutel](https://cv.hal.science/philippe-robutel). Official name:

> "Theoretical and numerical study of reccurent dynamics in dynamical systems and application to the N-body problem"

Here is the [link to the PhD page](https://theses.fr/s367065). Its main topics: celestial mechanics, dynamical systems, numerical computations.

@@colbox-blue I'm currently looking for a post-doctoral position anywhere in Europe, from September 2026 onward! If you are interested, you can contact me with the mail on the left.@@

## Studies

Before starting my PhD, I studied theoretical physics at the [ENS](https://www.ens.psl.eu/), followed by a final master year at the Observatoire de Paris, with an emphasis on the mathematical aspect of astrophysics. I studied computer science as an minor of the ENS diploma, especially compilation, reactive programming, computational topology and computer graphics (courses at the [Informatics Department of the ENS](https://www.di.ens.fr/), and the [MPRI](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/education/master/computer-science/m2-parisian-computer-sciences-research-master)).

# Around research

## Organizing conferences and seminars

For talks I gave, see [here](/talks).

- Co-chair of [JuliaCon Local Paris 2025](https://juliacon.org/local/paris2025/).
- Organizer of the [Julia in Paris meetup](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/julia-paris/).
- Organizer (treasurer) of the [Elbereth conference](https://conference-elbereth.github.io/)
- Co-organizer of AstroCalcul (seminar about scientific computing in astrophysics and astronomy)

## Scientific outreach

- Science outreach at the [Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie](https://www.cite-sciences.fr/fr/accueil/)
- A introductory roleplaying game (one-shot) about celestial mechanics! Currently in development and private testing.
- [Podcast](https://www.petitsreporters.fr/8-raphael-lallemand-alexandre-prieur-et-lespace/) with *Les Petits Reporters des Sciences* (link in french)

## Who am I

Alexandre. A PhD student in celestial mechanics. A programming enthusiast, especially in [Julia](https://julialang.org). Actually, enthusiast about a tad bit too many [hobbies](/hobbies).

## What do I do

### Research
I'm working at the interface between celestial mechanics, dynamical systems and numerical optimisation. See [Research](/research) for more.

### Scientific outreach
I also work at the [Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie](https://www.cite-sciences.fr/fr/accueil/), with the scientific outreach team. Here, I learned how to talk about science to kids and general public, and prepared several animations about science in general, and my work in particular (for instance, a roleplaying game about celestial mechanics!).

### Scientific life
I relaunched and am the current organizer of the Paris Julia meetup, [Julia Paris et Environ](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/julia-paris/). I am also a member of the organizing committee for the [JuliaCon Local Paris 2025](https://juliacon.org/local/paris2025/).

### Beyond work
Way too many [hobbies](/hobbies). Currently hyperfocusing on game development with Godot.
