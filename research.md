# Research

@@colbox-blue [Get my CV here](/assets/cv_prieur.pdf)@@

## Main interests

- Numerical methods: numerical integration, automatic differentiation, optimisation
- Dynamical systems: recurring dynamics, orbit stability
- Celestial mechanics: solar system evolution, small bodies, long-term trajectories

I focus on the interaction between various research domains, and always thrive to learn new subjects and methods to combine! For instance, I'd like to learn more about:

- Bifurcation theory
- Computer-assisted proofs
- Space debris
- Planetary defense


## Programming skills

### Julia: expert

[Julia](https://www.julialang.org) is my main language since 2022. I wrote [TaylorInterface.jl](https://www.github.com/alseidon/TaylorInterface.jl), and try to actively participate in the community (organizer of the [JuliaCon Local Paris 2025](https://juliacon.org/local/paris2025/) and the [Julia In Paris Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/julia-paris))

### C: advanced

I developed several projects in C, and interfaced the `taylor` integrator (which compiles to C code) with Julia.

### Other languages
- OCaml: intermediate
- Python: intermediate
- GDScript: intermediate
- Notions of: Bash, C++, Rust, HTML/CSS, JavaScript...
