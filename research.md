## Initial passions

Physics. Space, astronomy. Computer science.

## Currently

PhD at [LTE](https://lte.observatoiredeparis.psl.eu/) (ex-IMCCE), Observatoire de Paris, under supervision of [Jacques Fejoz](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~fejoz/) and [Philippe Robutel](https://cv.hal.science/philippe-robutel): "Theoretical and numerical study of reccurent dynamics in dynamical systems and application to the N-body problem". [Link to the PhD page.](https://theses.fr/s367065)

## Astrophysics

Astrophysics master. Theoretical physics at the ENS, with mathematical aspect of astrophysics at the Observatoire. Computer science as secondary theme: compilation, reactive programming, computational topology, computer graphics.

## Dynamical systems

IMCCE internship. Celestial mechanics.
