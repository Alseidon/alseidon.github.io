# Research

Hi! I'm a long-time space and physics enthusiast, and I had the chance to realize my dream of... well, not going to space, but studying it!

Currently, I am a PhD student at the [LTE](https://lte.observatoiredeparis.psl.eu/) (ex-IMCCE) laboratory, at the Observatoire de Paris, under the supervision of [Jacques Fejoz](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~fejoz/) and [Philippe Robutel](https://cv.hal.science/philippe-robutel). Official name:

> "Theoretical and numerical study of reccurent dynamics in dynamical systems and application to the N-body problem"

And a [link to the PhD page](https://theses.fr/s367065). Main topics: celestial mechanics, dynamical systems, numerical computations.

## Studies

Before starting my PhD, I studied theoretical phyics at the [ENS](https://www.ens.psl.eu/), followed by a final master year at the Observatoire de Paris, with an emphasis on the mathematical aspect of astrophysics. I studied computer science as a secondary theme, especially compilation, reactive programming, computational topology and computer graphics (courses at the [Informatics Department of the ENS](https://www.di.ens.fr/), and the [MPRI](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/education/master/computer-science/m2-parisian-computer-sciences-research-master)).

# Around research
