# Walkthroughs

Over the course of the last years, I experimented lots of stuff, mainly with computers and affiliated -- actually, making this website was such an experiment. Sometimes, a YouTube tutorial or a detailed guide gave me the exact steps to follow in order to succeed, simply and swiftly. Some other times, it was one or multiple obscure forum answers from a decade ago that unexpectedly helped me. And in some occasions... I got completely stuck.

So! Dearest reader, I wouldn't want that to happen to you. Thus, I will try to give some of the help I received from the (almost) all-knowing Internet back, and write about my aforementioned experiments. So, let's walk together on some of the tracks I traced.

\toc

## Installing Linux

Start simple, start with Ubuntu or affiliated. Rice it if you want!

## Improving Linux

[Better Linux basic commands](/walkthrough/useful_linux_commands)

## Installing Julia

Not that complicated, and well-explained. A tip: use `juliaup`. Maybe an opinionated article about Julia? [link](/walkthrough/first_steps_julia)

## Setting up a web server (still unsuccessful)

Easiest way for now : Apache2 on a Raspberry Pi.

## GitHub

GitHub, ssh key, core concepts of git.

## Add PPA repo, with the new, more secure way

Cf. taylor example

## Collection of Julia performance tips I found

AllocCheck.jl, read the [doc page](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/), it's great!

## Setting up this website

I set up this website using [Franklin.jl](https://franklinjl.org/) and [Githup Pages](https://pages.github.com/). [See here](/walkthrough/website_with_franklin) for more info!
